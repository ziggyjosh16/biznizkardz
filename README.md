## Prerequisites
- [Node.js > 12](https://nodejs.org) and npm (Recommended: Use nvm [linux](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) [windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows))


## Base dependencies

## Usage


### Step one: clone me
You can start by cloning this repository

After that you should proceed as with any javascript project:
- Go to your project's root folder and run `npm install`.
- Run `npm run ios` or `npm run android` to start your application!

### Option 2: Copy the structure to your project
If you want to roll on your own and don't want to use this as a template, you can create your own project and then copy the `/src` folder (which has all the code of your application) and update your `index.js`.

Keep in mind that if you do this, you'll have to **install and link** all dependencies (as well as adding all the necessary native code for each library that requires it).
